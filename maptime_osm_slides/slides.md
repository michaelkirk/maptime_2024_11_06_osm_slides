# <br /><br />Using OpenStreetMap Data

Now that we've all spent some time putting data **into** OSM,
let's get some data **out** of OSM.

# But first...
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pedantic diversion.

# Geometry: Where the thing is

All geometry in OSM is stored as latitude and longitude (e.g. no projected points).

# It's a big planet out there.

<div class="column">

To avoid examining the entire planet, typically you'll "bound" your area of interest.

# Tags: A closer look. üëÄ

<h1>Using OpenStreetMap Data</h1>

Now that we've all spent some time putting data **into** OSM,
let's get some data **out** of OSM.

Overpass Turbo is a website for getting specific data out of OSM.

<img style="max-width: 80%" src="images%2Foverpass-timeout.png" />
What if I need a bigger (or faster) export?

# do. it. yourself.

Rather than asking a website to run your queries, download all the data for your area and filter tags on your own computer.

# Download the data

Geofabrik "pre-slices" OSM data into commonly useful chunks.

<https://download.geofabrik.de>

‚ö†Ô∏èYou probably want the `.osm.pbf` file format.

[Washington state](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/washington.html) is about 300MB

# Filter the tags 

I use the [`osmium`](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/) command line tool for this.

Extract seattle from the washington state file:
```
osmium extract washington-latest.osm.pbf \
  --bbox=-122.459696,47.481002,-122.224433,47.734136 \
  -o seattle.osm.pbf 
```

Get post offices in seattle:
```
osmium tags-filter seattle.osm.pbf \
  n/amenity=post_office \
  -o seattle_post_offices.osm.pbf 
```

Convert to geojson:
```
osmium export seattle_post_offices.osm.pbf \
  -o seattle_post_offices.geojson \
  -f geojson
```

Osmium also has somewhat complicated syntax.

Of course not.

Of course not. But it's pretty good for some things!

# Is OSM Complete?

Of course not. But it's pretty good for some things!

Best with things that don't frequently change:

- major geographic features
- political borders
- most roads
- buildings in larger cities
- long-lived businesses, churches, libraries, hospitals
- places where map nerds with extra time live

# Is OSM Complete?

Conversely, OSM is less good at things that change often.

- recently opened businesses
- tags not visible on osm.org (non-geometry data) tend to be worse
  - website URLs
  - business opening hours
  - minor roads, less populated areas

# So, *should* you use OSM data?

# So, *should* you use OSM data?

  - Completeness: Best for things that don't change a lot.

It's a public website, like wikipedia, so vandalism happens.
But it's usually cleaned up quickly.

<https://daylightmap.org> (Meta/Microsoft and others) "curates" a subset of OSM for this purpose. But it's being discontinued. ü§∑

# Is OSM data reliable?

Well... it depends.

# Where does OSM data come from?

Mostly volunteers.
  - Passing hobbyists with a few minutes to spend.
  - Prolific enthusiasts (like [Clifford](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Glassman)!).
  - People like [me](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/michael_kirk) who make about 3 edits a year. üò¨

# Where does OSM data come from?

More and more coporate editing for specific datasets - e.g. amazon and driveways.

# So, *should* you use OSM data?

- Completeness: Best for things that don't change a lot.
- Correctness: Usually pretty good, but account for reasonable limitations.

# Licensing

OSM data is licensed under the Open Database License (ODbL).

Generally it's OK to use OSM data in your projects, but you must attribute OSM and share your derived data under the same license.

# Using OpenStreetMap Data

Now that we've all spent a bunch of time putting data into OSM,
let's get it back out again.

> It can take a couple of minutes forÂ [changes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Changeset "Changeset")Â to theÂ [database](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database "Database")Â to show up in the Overpass API query results.

Quick and "easy" for small-ish "one-time" exports. {.my-class}

What if I need a bigger export? Or I want to perform a bunch of different queries quickly?

# osmium cli tool

Rather than querying a remote API, download "all the data" and do queries locally with osmosis 

Map template... web map?
QGIS project?

Assets to have available: Seattle.osm.pbf?

# Where does OSM data come from?

Mostly volunteers.
  - Passing hobbyists with a few minutes to spend.
  - Prolific enthusiasts (like [Clifford](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Glassman)!).
  - People like [me](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/michael_kirk) who make about 3 edits a year. ðŸ˜¬

# Where does OSM data come from?

More and more coporate editing for specific datasets - e.g. amazon and driveways.

# Using OpenStreetMap Data

Now that we've all spent a bunch of time putting data into OSM,
let's get it back out again.

# overpass t-t-turbo!!! üî•üî•üî•

Overpass Turbo is a website for extracting data from OSM.

<https://overpass-turbo.eu>

# Overpass: ‚ö†Ô∏è caveats

<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API>

> It can take a couple of minutes for¬†[changes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Changeset "Changeset")¬†to the¬†[database](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database "Database")¬†to show up in the Overpass API query results.

# Overpass: ‚ö†Ô∏è caveats

Quick and "easy" for small-ish one-off exports.

What if I need a bigger (or faster) export?

# osmium (cli tool)

Rather than querying a remote API, download "all the data" and do queries locally.

Of course not.

Of course not. But it's pretty good for some things!

Best with things that don't frequently change:

- major geographic features
- political borders
- most roads
- buildings dense areas
- long lived businesses, churches, libraries, hospitals
- places where map nerds with extra time live

# Is OSM Complete?

Conversely, OSM is less good at things that change often.

- recently opened businesses
- website URLs
- business opening hours
- minor roads, less populated areas

It's a public website, like wikipedia, so vandalism happens.
But it's usually cleaned up quickly.

<https://daylightmap.org> (Meta/Microsoft and others) exists as a "curated" subset of OSM for this purpose. Unfortunately it's being discontinued.

# Is OSM data reliable?

Well... it depends.

# Where does OSM data come from?

Mostly volunteers.
  - Passing hobbyists with a few minutes to spend.
  - Prolific enthusiasts (like [Clifford](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Glassman)!).
  - People like [me](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/michael_kirk) who make about 3 edits a year. üò¨

# Where does OSM data come from?

More and more coporate editing for specific datasets - e.g. amazon and driveways.
